            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download (1).png&title=Matrix Diagram(roof shaped)%20&info=A matrix diagram with a roof-shaped structure is a visual tool used in quality management to analyze relationships between multiple factors. It organizes data in a triangular matrix format resembling a roof, with categories along the diagonal and intersecting cells representing interactions between those categories. This diagram helps identify correlations, dependencies, and strengths of relationships within a complex system. The roof-shaped structure emphasizes the hierarchical nature of relationships, with broader categories at the top narrowing down to more specific ones at the bottom. It's commonly employed in Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), and process improvement initiatives to visualize and prioritize factors influencing quality or performance. By visually mapping these relationships, organizations can better understand the interconnectedness of various elements and make informed decisions to enhance efficiency and effectiveness."><img src="Table images/download (1).png" alt="Image 6"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download (2).png&title=Matrix Heatmap%20&info=A matrix heatmap is a graphical representation that combines the structure of a matrix with the color intensity of a heatmap. It displays data in a grid-like format where rows and columns represent different categories, variables, or items. Each cell in the matrix is filled with a color gradient or intensity based on the value of the data it represents. The color scale typically ranges from low (e.g., light colors) to high (e.g., dark colors) values, allowing for quick visualization of patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Matrix heatmaps are commonly used in fields such as data analysis, genetics, finance, and market research to identify correlations, outliers, and clusters in large datasets. They provide a visually intuitive way to understand complex data and make informed decisions."><img src="Table images/download (2).png" alt="Image 8"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download (3).png&title=SWOT Analysis%20&info=It's a strategic planning tool used by individuals and organizations to identify internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats in a given situation or project. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors, such as resources, capabilities, or processes, while opportunities and threats are external factors, such as market trends, competition, or regulatory changes. SWOT analysis helps in formulating strategies by leveraging strengths, addressing weaknesses, capitalizing on opportunities, and mitigating threats. It's widely used in business, marketing, project management, and personal development to assess current circumstances and make informed decisions about future actions."><img src="Table images/download (3).png" alt="Image 8"></a>

            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download (4).png&title=Matrix Diagram%20&info=A matrix diagram is a visual tool used to analyze the relationships between different sets of data. It typically consists of a grid-like structure where rows and columns represent different categories, factors, or variables. The intersection points within the matrix indicate the relationship or interaction between the corresponding categories. Matrix diagrams help to organize and display complex information, allowing for easy identification of patterns, dependencies, and connections. They are commonly used in quality management, project management, and decision-making processes to clarify relationships and aid in problem-solving and planning."><img src="=Table images/download (4).png" alt="Image 9"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download (12).png&title=Comparision Chart%20&info=A comparison chart is a visual representation that allows for a side-by-side comparison of different items, attributes, or variables. It typically consists of columns and rows, with each column representing a different item or category, and each row representing a specific attribute or feature being compared. The data within the chart can be presented using various graphical elements such as bars, lines, or symbols to highlight differences or similarities. Comparison charts are commonly used in various fields including business, education, and research to make informed decisions, analyze trends, and evaluate options based on key criteria."><img src="Table images/download (12).png" alt="Image 6"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=Table images/download.png&title=Matrix Diagram(Y shaped)%20&info=A matrix diagram with a Y-shaped structure is a visual tool used in quality management and decision-making processes to analyze relationships and interactions between multiple factors or categories. It features a Y-shaped layout, with one main category branching out into two or more subcategories. The main category typically represents a broader concept or theme, while the subcategories represent specific aspects or components related to that main category. This diagram helps to visualize the hierarchical nature of relationships, with the main category serving as a focal point and the subcategories branching out from it. It's commonly utilized in Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), and process improvement initiatives to identify connections, dependencies, and opportunities for optimization within complex systems or processes."><img src="Table images/download.png" alt="Image 7"></a>
