            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=chart images/download (12).png&title=Water Fall plot%20&info=A waterfall plot is a type of data visualization commonly used to represent the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. It is particularly useful in fields such as finance, engineering, and scientific research to illustrate how an initial value is influenced by a series of intermediate steps or changes. The plot typically starts with an initial bar representing the starting value, followed by bars that represent the incremental changes, either additions or subtractions. Each bar starts from the end point of the previous bar, which helps to show the progression over time or across categories. The final bar represents the net result after all changes have been accounted for. This type of chart makes it easier to understand how individual elements contribute to the total change. In finance, waterfall charts are often used to explain changes in revenue, profit, or expenses over a period. The visualization can highlight specific drivers of performance and identify key areas for improvement."><img src="chart images/download (12).png" alt="Image 6"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=chart images/download (15).png&title=Stacked Area Chart%20&info= A stacked area chart is a type of data visualization used to display quantitative data over time, with each area representing a category stacked on top of the others. It uses different colors to show the contribution of each category, illustrating how these contributions change over time. This chart type is ideal for comparing proportions and identifying trends in time series data, such as monthly sales for various products. By stacking the data series, it provides a cumulative visual representation, helping to see both the total and individual category trends simultaneously. Commonly used in business, finance, and scientific research, stacked area charts are effective for displaying data like revenue, expenses, and population distributions. Digital versions often include interactivity, allowing users to hover for detailed data points. Customization options enhance readability and visual appeal, though charts can become cluttered with too many categories, making smaller category changes hard to discern."><img src="chart images/download (15).png" alt="Image 8"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=chart images/download (17).png&title=Hyperbolic Tree%20&info=A hyperbolic tree is a data visualization technique that uses hyperbolic geometry to display large hierarchical structures compactly within a circular area, making it more space-efficient than traditional tree diagrams.
