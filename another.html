            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=images/grouped bar chart.png.&title=Grouped chart%20&info=A group chart, also known as a clustered or grouped bar chart, is a graphical representation used to compare multiple categories across different groups. It displays bars for each category side by side within each group, allowing for straightforward comparison of data. Each group typically represents a distinct variable or time period, with different colors or patterns used to differentiate the categories within each group. This type of chart is particularly useful for visualizing data that has sub-categories, as it makes it easy to see patterns and differences both within and across groups. It is widely used in business, education, and research to analyze and present data effectively, aiding in decision-making processes by providing clear, comparative insights. Group charts can be created using various tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, and specialized data visualization software."><img src="images/grouped bar chart.png" alt="Image 6"></a>

            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=images/download.png.&title=Histogram%20&info=A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data, where data values are grouped into intervals called bins, and the frequency or count of data points falling within each bin is plotted as bars. The horizontal axis represents the range of values divided into intervals, while the vertical axis shows the frequency or count of data points within each interval. Histograms provide a visual summary of the data's distribution, allowing viewers to quickly identify patterns, trends, and outliers. They are commonly used in fields such as statistics, data analysis, and quality control to explore the central tendency, variability, and shape of a dataset. Proper selection of bin widths and intervals is important for accurately representing the data and interpreting the resulting histogram. Overall, histograms offer an effective way to visualize and understand the distribution of numerical data."><img src="images/download.png" alt="Image 9"></a>
