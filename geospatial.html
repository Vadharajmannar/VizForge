            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (1).png&title=Pin Map%20&info=A pin map, also known as a point map or dot map, is a data visualization technique used to display spatial data by placing individual points or markers on a map to represent specific locations. Each point or marker typically corresponds to a data point, such as a geographic coordinate or address, and may be symbolized with different colors, sizes, or shapes to represent different attributes or categories of data. Pin maps are commonly used to visualize the distribution of data points across geographic areas, such as the locations of customers, stores, or events. They provide a clear and intuitive way to identify spatial patterns, clusters, and trends within the data, making them valuable tools for spatial analysis, market research, urban planning, and other applications where geographic relationships are important."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (1).png" alt="Image 6"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (2).png&title=Route ap%20&info=A route map is a visual representation of a specific journey or route, typically depicted using lines or arrows on a map to indicate the path of travel from one location to another. It may include additional information such as points of interest, landmarks, or stops along the route, as well as distance markers or directions. Route maps are commonly used for navigation, trip planning, and tourism purposes, helping travelers visualize the route they will take and understand the spatial relationships between different locations. They are also useful for logistics, transportation planning, and outdoor activities such as hiking or biking, providing clear guidance and context for the journey ahead."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (2).png" alt="Image 8"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (3).png&title=Cartogramm%20&info=A cartogram is a type of thematic map that distorts geographical areas or shapes based on a specific variable, such as population, income, or electoral votes, rather than representing them accurately. The distortion is intended to visually emphasize the spatial distribution of the chosen variable, with regions resized proportionally to their value. For example, areas with higher population densities may appear larger, while those with lower densities may appear smaller. Cartograms are useful for highlighting patterns and trends in data that may not be immediately apparent on a traditional map, providing a clearer understanding of spatial relationships and disparities."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (3).png" alt="Image 8"></a>

            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (4).png&title=Connection map%20&info=
            A connection map is a type of data visualization that illustrates the relationships and connections between various entities or nodes within a network. Unlike traditional maps that focus on geographical locations, connection maps emphasize the links, interactions, or dependencies between different elements. These connections are typically represented by lines, arcs, or arrows, with each line indicating a relationship or interaction between two nodes. Connection maps are commonly used in fields such as social network analysis, transportation planning, supply chain management, and telecommunications to visualize and analyze complex networks of relationships."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (4).png" alt="Image 9"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (5).png&title=Topographic Map%20&info=A topographic map is a detailed and accurate representation of natural and man-made features on the Earth's surface, including elevation, terrain, vegetation, water bodies, and human structures. These maps use contour lines to depict changes in elevation, allowing viewers to visualize the shape and relief of the land. Topographic maps also include symbols and colors to represent various features such as roads, buildings, forests, rivers, and cultural landmarks. They provide valuable information for outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, surveyors, geologists, and urban planners, aiding in navigation, land use planning, environmental management, and scientific research."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (5).png" alt="Image 6"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (6).png&title=Isoloine Map%20&info=An isoline map, also known as a contour map or isopleth map, is a type of thematic map that represents continuous data using lines of equal value, known as isolines. These lines connect points on the map that share the same value of a particular variable, such as temperature, elevation, rainfall, or population density. Isoline maps use contour lines to depict gradual changes in the variable across the map's surface, with lines spaced closer together indicating steeper gradients or sharper changes in value, and lines spaced farther apart indicating gentler gradients or more gradual changes. Isoline maps are widely used in fields such as geography, meteorology, hydrology, and environmental science to visualize and analyze spatial patterns, distributions, and gradients in data."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (6).png" alt="Image 7"></a>

            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (7).png&title=Profile Map%20&info=A profile map, also known as a cross-sectional map or elevation profile, is a type of map that displays the vertical elevation of the terrain along a specific line or route. Typically, this line represents a path such as a hiking trail, road, or river, and the profile map shows how the elevation changes along that path. The map often includes a graph or chart alongside the line, with elevation on the vertical axis and distance along the path on the horizontal axis. This graph allows viewers to visualize the changes in elevation as they travel along the route, providing valuable information for hikers, cyclists, engineers, and planners."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (7).png" alt="Image 8"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (8).png&title=Bubble Map%20&info=A bubble map is a type of data visualization that uses bubbles or circles to represent data points on a map. Each bubble typically represents a geographic location or area, and the size or color of the bubble corresponds to a specific attribute or value associated with that location. Bubble maps are useful for visualizing spatial patterns, distributions, and variations in data across different regions or locations. They are commonly used in fields such as demographics, economics, and public health to display information such as population density, income levels, or disease prevalence."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (8).png" alt="Image 9"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (9).png&title=Flow Map%20&info=A flow map is a type of data visualization that illustrates the movement or flow of objects, people, goods, or information between different geographic locations or regions. These maps typically use arrows or lines to represent the direction and volume of movement, with thicker or longer lines indicating higher volumes of flow. Flow maps can be static or dynamic and are commonly used in fields such as transportation planning, migration studies, supply chain management, and telecommunications to visualize and analyze spatial patterns of movement. They provide valuable insights into the spatial relationships, connections, and dynamics within a system, aiding in decision-making, policy planning, and resource allocation."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (9).png" alt="Image 6"></a>

            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download (10).png&title=Choropleth Map%20&info=A choropleth map is a thematic map that uses color shading or patterns to represent spatial variations in data across geographic regions, such as countries, states, or municipalities. The map is divided into areas or polygons, each of which is shaded or patterned based on the value of a particular variable. Darker or more intense colors typically represent higher values, while lighter or less intense colors represent lower values. Choropleth maps are commonly used to visualize statistical data, such as population density, income levels, or election results, allowing viewers to quickly discern spatial patterns and trends."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download (10).png" alt="Image 7"></a>
            <a href="visualization_info.html?img=geospatial images/attachments/download.png&title=Bar Chart on Map%20&info=A bar chart on a map, also known as a thematic bar map, is a data visualization technique that combines the features of both a bar chart and a map. In this visualization, bars are positioned on a map to represent quantitative data associated with specific geographic locations or regions. Each bar's length or height corresponds to the value of a variable at the corresponding location, providing a visual representation of spatial patterns or distributions. Thematic bar maps are commonly used to illustrate spatial variations in data such as population density, economic indicators, or environmental factors. They allow viewers to quickly grasp the geographic distribution of the data and identify regions with higher or lower values."><img src="geospatial images/attachments/download.png" alt="Image 8"></a>
